# Life-Expectancy-Prediction

This project purpose is to study the dataset provided by the World Health Organization on 
the life expectancy of Countries around the world. Although there have been lot of studies
done in the past studying the factors affecting life expectancy considering demographic
variables, income composition and mortality rates, it was found that the effect of
immunization and human development index was rarely taken into account. Also, some of
the past research were done using multiple linear regression based on a data set of a single
year for all the countries. Therefore, this motivates us to resolve both the factors stated
previously by formulating a regression model based on mixed features on a dataset from a
period of 2000 to 2015 for almost all the countries. This model will focus on immunization
factors, mortality factors, economic factors, social factors and other health related factors
as well. The analysis of this data will allow the mentioned countries to determine the
predicting factor which is contributing to a low value of life expectancy. This will also help
the country to know which area should be given importance in order to efficiently improve
the life expectancy of its population.

Motivation 
 
The data-set aims to answer the following key questions:
1. Do various predicting factors which has been chosen initially really affect the Life
    expectancy? What are the predicting variables actually affecting the life expectancy?
2. Should a country having a lower life expectancy value (<65) increase its healthcare
    expenditure in order to improve its average lifespan?
3. How does Infant and Adult mortality rates affect life expectancy?
4. What is the impact of schooling on the lifespan of humans?
5. Does Life Expectancy have positive or negative relationship with drinking alcohol?
6. Do densely populated countries tend to have lower life expectancy?
7. What is the impact of Immunization coverage on life Expectancy?
